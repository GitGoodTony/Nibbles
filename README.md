# Nibbles

This is a basic clone of the game, Snake. The clone is not the best, but it should be enjoyable.

Use arrow keys to control your snake and eat all the apples! Apple locations are revealed by crosshairs that turn green when your snake's head overlaps them.

If you eat yourself or the wall, you will die. Click any arrow to restart the game then.

You can change the speed by changing the speed constant's speed in line 16 within NibblesGame.java

Score (and high score of current session) is found at the top left hand section of the game window.
